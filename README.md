The model uses deep learning to perform transcription and speaker gender determination. The transcription feature is only available in the "Transcription by Julius" version.

The speech data used to train this model is provided by the JVS (Japanese versatile speech) corpus (https://sites.google.com/site/shinnosuketakamichi/research-topics/jvs_corpus).
